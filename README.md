## Overview
Goals for this project:
Complete data assessment of dataset and outline findings
- Note: this is an explanation of your understanding of the data, calling out any issues or obstacles in the quality or structure of the data. This will be a combination of written word and numerical information. This can be included as a separate document or in the appendix of your presentation.\
Analyze data set to produce insight report
- Note: analysis plan and methods of enquiry are at the student’s discretion. This is designed to be a hands-on application of the analysis and data science tools you have learned during your program.
The output of this section of the homework will be; a) the contents of the Insight report (i.e. what you have learned from the data and analysis) and b) the action list of steps you took – including any code or models used.
Create Insight report and key executive summary
- Note: This is an executive summary presentation, up to 10 slides (not including appendix) that present the analysis and what is learnt from the data. Students are encouraged to use any form of visualization (including graphs and charts) that they feel aids the explanation and analysis of the data.
Create action list of steps
- Note: This is a list of steps taken. A simple description of your work at a high level.

## General structure for insight in presentation
Note the following insights for the presentation:
- Small time frame of data in addition to adding American Airlines only for the last 3 days
- Sentiment analysis for positive and negative tweets
- Negative sentiment for all airlines

## Inspiration for presentation/deeper breakdown
- background on flights and cancelations
    - look at the timeframe of the data and outside events (weather)
- crappy data and troubles found
    - nulled out categories, etc.
- sentiment analysis
    - overall negative sentiment
- how did people tweet?
- overall sentiment
- reasons per airline
- reasons per airline continued

## Deliverables
1. data assessment and overall findings
    - in seperate document
2. data analysis for insight report
    - in seperate document and includes analysis plan (code I used) and steps I took
3. presentation of analysis and what was learned from the data
4. high level view of action steps taken

## Resources
The original data set linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment in addition to the notebooks present on the Kaggle link were used to create
the notebook in this repo. I do not take credit for the data set or any externally used code in the compiled notebook.
